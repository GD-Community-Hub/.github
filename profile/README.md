# GDHub
GDHub is a place where you can find everything about Geometry Dash.

This place is currently in really work in progress, but for now, we've got multiple big projects going on that you can check out!

## [The GD Timeline](https://github.com/GD-Community-Hub/Timeline)
This is (for now) the only project on GDHub. It aims to document the entire history of Geometry Dash, along with a large selection of articles regarding these events. The events on the Timeline are written by multiple authors, and it can be one of you as well!

The website is currently in the Beta 1.2 release.
> Where can I contribute to TGT?

We have a Discord server (I'll put the link here when I can find it), for now - just DM the owner @EsmiK#2706.

## How to contribute?
To contribute to GDH directly, you can message the owner (EsmiK#2706) on Discord, as written below. I'd love if somebody was willing to collaborate!

## I'm a GD Website owner, can I still somehow help?
Yes! We can partner - and that means that I'll show your website on GDHub in the resources section.
It doesn't exist *yet*, but we can still talk about it.
